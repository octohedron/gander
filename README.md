# Gender guesser written in Go

### Used data from the [python gender guesser](https://github.com/lead-ratings/gender-guesser)

## Motivation

Currently, the [python gender guesser](https://github.com/lead-ratings/gender-guesser) can take up to 1 second on my laptop per name, which is not a big deal but if you have to process 100M names, it could take 3 years, this should do it in less than 1 hour.
